# RyutoKitagawa.github.io

An extremely rough personal website, using
[https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio](vCard)
as the base.

The website is mostly static, and a lot of the code to generate the website
was my own work. Which means it is terrible and I do not recommend anyone use
my code as a base for their own website.
