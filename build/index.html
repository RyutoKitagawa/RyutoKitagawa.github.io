              I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the
              University of California, Irvine
              in the 
              <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~theory/" style="display: inline">
                Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation
              </a>.
              My academic advisor is
              <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/" style="display: inline">
                Dr. Michael Goodrich
              </a>.

            <p>
              My current research interests are in the field of designing algorithms
              and data structures for massively parallel computing systems.
              I am currently working on several projects related to GPU
              programming, from both a theoretical and experimental perspective.
              I also have an interest in data sketching algorithms, which are
              the summarization of large data sets in a small amount of space
              (sadly this has nothing to do with drawing, which is not a strong
              suite of mine).
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of research, I consider programming to be one of my main
              hobbies.
              I am a big fan of Neovim as a coding environment and enjoy tweaking
              my setup during my free time.
              I also spend a non-significant amount of time trying to out
              different operating systems and window managers.
              My current setup is based heavily around NixOS, which uses a
              unique declarative approach to configuration management.
              The two main features that I enjoy is the rollback feature, which
              helps me recover from my own mistakes, and the ability to port
              my configuration to other machines with minimal effort.
              For more information about NixOS as a whole, I recommend checking
              out

            <p>
              I do have a life outside of computers, I swear.
              I enjoy playing the guitar and ukulele, and have been playing
              at a novice level for the past 8 years.
              I have recently begun going on walks around my neighborhood and
              taking photos of random things I see.
              I also enjoy cooking and have been recently trying various
              recipes of Mexican cuisine.
